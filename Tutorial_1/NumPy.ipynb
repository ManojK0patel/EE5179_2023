Can't we just use Python lists?\n","    Iterating over numpy arrays is slow. Slicing is faster\n","\n","Python lists may contain items of different types. This flexibility comes at a price: Python lists store pointers to memory locations. On the other hand, numpy arrays are typed, where the default type is floating point. Because of this, the system knows how much memory to allocate, and if you ask for an array of size 100, it will allocate one hundred contiguous spots in memory, where the size of each spot is based on the type. This makes access extremely fast.\n","\n","\n","If you want to know more, we will suggest that you read this from [Jake Vanderplas's Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). You will find that book an incredible resource for learning numpy, pandas and plotting.
